Challenges Faced:
          It was a bit hard for me to figure out how to make a repository, at first I accidentally forgot to add readme file in it so I thought it was better if I remake it, but when I started making it again it was giving me error that I can't make repository with same name so first I had to delete the old one then remake the new one.
          The second challenge I faced was on how to make a branch (feature-update), after figuring that out it took me a while to read and understand the process of merging, for me it was the hardest challenge to face as it was a very new thing for me to do. 
          Once I was done with updating my file, I pushed changes to a remote repository and wrote this description.

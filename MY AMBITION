My dream is to become a VFX artist and a 3D environment and character artist for games and animation. I have always been fascinated by how games create entire worlds that feel alive and how animated characters can express emotions just like real people. I want to design stunning game environments, create unique characters, and add special effects that make everything more exciting. Imagine crafting a mysterious forest glowing with magical lights or designing a fierce warrior with armor that tells a story,this is what I want to do! Games and animation have the power to transport people into different worlds, and I want to be the one creating those worlds. I know it takes a lot of learning and practice, but I am eager to improve my skills every day. My goal is to work on games and animated films and series that inspire people, making them feel the same excitement and wonder that I feel when I see amazing VFX and 3D art.
